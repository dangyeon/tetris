* A single level (with gentle G=1/48 gravity) of the game.
* All of the seven tetrominos are generated.
* The game  consists of a 10 wide, 20 high playfield. (Note that to achieve credit or higher you should make the playfield 22 rows high to accommodate a two-row vanish zone).
* Tetrominos  correctly falls and piles up on the floor of the game.
* Tetrominos  correctly rotates according to keyboard input and the SRS rotation scheme.

* Randomly generated tetrominos fall.
* The game  correctly implements line clearing with naive gravity.
* The game  correctly implements the vanish zone using rows 21 and 22.
* The game implements a scoring system (your choice).

* The game  executes with a "frame rate" of 60 frames per second use 1/60 of
* a second as the basic quantum of time. 
* a clock of current game

* The game  implements more than one level, with increasing gravity.
* The game  implements piece preview.
* wallkick
* auto-repeat
* soft drops
* background music(midi)
